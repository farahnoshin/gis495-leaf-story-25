  <p>Bangladesh is often called <b>the Land of Rivers</b>. With a total of <b>1,415 rivers</b> flowing across the country, these waterways play a crucial role in shaping its economy and daily life.</p>

  <p>Rivers provide numerous benefits to the people of Bangladesh, including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Making the land fertile for agriculture</li>
    <li>Providing a major source of food and livelihoods</li>
    <li>Supporting transportation and communication</li>
    <li>Enabling trade and economic activities</li>
  </ul>

  <p>However, these same rivers can also become a source of danger. When they overflow, they can trigger <b>devastating floods</b>, invading people’s homes, land, and resources.</p>

1,<p><b>When Rivers Bring Floods</b></p>,media/Flood_1.jpg,Source: Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/millions-stranded-floods-ravage-bangladesh-more-rain-forecast-2022-06-18/,"<div style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6;"">
  <p>
    The geographic location and the flat, low-lying topography make Bangladesh 
    one of the most <b>flood-prone countries in the world</b>.
  </p>

  <p>Floods have been a recurring threat for decades:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Between <b>1971 and 2014</b>, Bangladesh experienced 
      <b>78 major flood events</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
      These floods caused the deaths of approximately 
      <b>42,000 people</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The estimated economic loss during this period amounts to 
      <b>USD 12.2 billion</b>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Today, more than <b>70 million people</b> in Bangladesh live in 
    flood-prone areas, placing their lives, livelihoods, and properties at 
    constant risk.

2,<p><b>Who are affected by Floods?</b></p>,media/Flood_2.jpg,Source: UNICEF,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154036,"<div style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6;"">

  <p>
    Floods disproportionately affect <b>children, older adults, and other socially
    disadvantaged groups</b>, many of whom require additional support and protection during
    disaster events.
  </p>

  <p>Key inequities in flood impacts include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The <b>lowest income households</b> lose nearly all of their income during disaster
      periods, while the <b>highest income households</b> experience only a small reduction.
    </li>
    <li>
      Infants born to mothers living in <b>flood-prone areas</b> suffer markedly higher
      mortality rates in their first year compared to those born in safer regions.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These patterns reveal that the impacts of flooding in Bangladesh are 
    <b>highly unequal across social and demographic groups</b>. This underscores the critical 
    need for <b>targeted, equity-focused disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation 
    policies</b> to protect the most vulnerable populations.

  <h3>Objectives of the Study</h3>
  <ol style=""padding-left: 20px;"">
    <li>
      Visualize the <b>flood-affected areas in Bangladesh in 2021</b> using the existing
      <b>surface water map</b> and <b>flood risk map</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Determine the <b>Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)</b> at the <b>district level</b> using
      relevant factors from the <b>Census 2022</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Merge the <b>SVI</b> with <b>2021 flood exposure</b> and <b>flood risk</b>, and visualize
      their intersection to identify areas with both <b>high social vulnerability</b> and
      <b>high flood exposure or risk</b>.

4,<p><b>How the Social Vulnerability varies across Districts in Bangladesh?</b></p>,media/SVI_map.jpg,,,"<div style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6; max-width: 650px;"">
  <p>
    The map shows that social vulnerability varies significantly across Bangladesh. 
    Districts in the <b>northern, central, and southeastern regions</b> display higher 
    Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) values, represented by <b>darker red areas</b>. These 
    locations typically have <b>limited socioeconomic resources</b>, <b>higher population 
    pressures</b>, and <b>reduced access to essential services</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In contrast, districts shaded in lighter colors indicate <b>lower vulnerability</b>, 
    reflecting better social and economic conditions. The clear spatial variation shown 
    in the map underscores the importance of <b>region-specific strategies</b> to reduce 
    social vulnerability and strengthen resilience.

  <p>
    The map shows that social vulnerability varies across Bangladesh, with 
    several <b>eastern and northern districts</b> displaying higher SVI levels 
    (darker blue). These areas tend to have weaker socioeconomic conditions and 
    greater exposure to climate risks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Districts in <b>lighter shades</b> reflect lower vulnerability, indicating 
    better access to resources and stronger social resilience. The spatial 
    differences highlight the need for <b>district-specific strategies</b> to 
    reduce vulnerability.

  The map highlights the districts where <b>high flood exposure</b> and

  the regions facing the greatest combined risk, where communities are both highly 
  exposed to flooding and have limited capacity to cope or recover.

<p>
  Only a small number of districts fall into this high-risk intersection, making 
  them critical priorities for <b>targeted disaster preparedness, support programs,

This study shows that some communities in Bangladesh face both the highest flood risks and the greatest social vulnerability. These are real people living with uncertainty and limited resources.
